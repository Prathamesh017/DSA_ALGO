Important
* Using & and ^ 1 to set the last bit accordingly
* XOR of any Number(n^n) is 0 and 0 and Number is still Number
* Pattern Explained in 4 question
* XOR actually helps in differentation of 2 bits
like only same bits return 1
* (no%2===1) is same as (no&1)
* (no=(no/2)) is same as  no=no>>1;
*  2^n is same as 1>>n
* to set a bit use | OR
* to check set bit use &
