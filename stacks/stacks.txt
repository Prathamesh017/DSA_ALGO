Stacks
Stacks is a simple data structure which stores data that follows Last-In-First-Principal (LIFO)

Basic Operations on Stack:
In order to make manipulations in a stack, there are certain operations provided to us.
push() to insert an element into the stack
pop() to remove an element from the stack
top() Returns the top element of the stack.
isEmpty() returns true if stack is empty else false.
isFull() returns true if the stack is full else false.


Monotonic Stack - Ascending Order Stack

Approaches
* When Soln needs adjacent values 
* When we we have to find `Next Smaller Number to LEFT` (NSL) , Next Smaller Number to RIGHT(NSR)
* When we we have to find `Next Larger Number to LEFT` (NLL) , Next Larger Number to RIGHT(NLR)
