Binary Search Tree
Binary Search Tree has leftNode<Root && Root<RightNode for every subtree

It doesn't contain duplicates generally in most cases
The Height of such trees in most cases is log2n  (pretty much self explainatory as left always is smaller than root)

The reason it is called binary search tree as searching a value in this tree is similar to binary search tree.   

The Inorder traversal in binary search tree is always sorted as inorder is left-root-right and BST is left<root &&  root<right
